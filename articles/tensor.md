## Vectors as Deriviatves

Most of us have dealth with parametric functions. We can take the derivaitve of the parametric curve and get a vector field representig tangent vectors at each point. Parametric curves usally involv some "universal variable" $t$ and the the function $\vec{R}(t)$ will output the curve (effectively a function that yields a position vector). As we enumerate all $t$ we will trace entire the curve. 

If want to the tangent vectors over the curve we have to find the deriviatve $\frac{d \vec{R}}{dt}$. If we write the derivaitive using its limit definition

$$\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\vec{R}(t+h)-\vec{R}(t)}{h}$$

The limit will give us the tangent vectors along the curve. If we expand $\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$ with the fact that $x=u(t)$ and $y=v(t)$ we get the following

$$\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt} = \frac{\partial \vec{R}}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{dt} + \frac{\partial \vec{R}}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

Note that things like $\frac{dx}{dt}$ are scalar while $\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$ are vector values. What effectively we have the deriative $\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$ written as two component scalar values ($\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}$) each paired with there own "basis vector" ($\frac{d\vec{R}}{dx}$ and $\frac{d\vec{R}}{dy}$)

In other words that any deritivative can be treated as vector which has its own unique components and basis that go along with it. 

## The Jacboian

We can sswap between different basis vectors by using the Jacboian.
