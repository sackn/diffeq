### Extra Practice and Solutions
UCB section 4 is all about cross product
Shimamoto section 2.5 is also all about cross product and orthagonality. 

**UCB Question 4.1**
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  $\vec{u}\times \vec{v}$ can not be a scalar multiple of $vec{u}$. As previously shown the dot product $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{u}||\vec{v}|cos(\theta)$. To be perpendicular the dot product must equal zero. However, if the cross product is a a scalar multiple of $\vec{u}$ then the angle between them is 0 making
  $cos(0) = 1$. If we assume that neither vectors are the zero vector then the dot product will always be equal to $|\vec{u}||k\vec{u}|$ a distinctly not negative number.

**UCB Question 4.2**
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  I'm not going to do a formal proof its kind of intuitive. If $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are perpendicular then there is a 90 degree angle between them. That also implies that they form a right triangle and right triangles are associated with the ever famous pythagoream theorem. The theorem is written using the magitudes
  of vectors rather than simply side lengths, but regardless they are equivalent.

**UCB Problem 4.1**
<details>
  <summary>Part A Solution</summary>
  $$\vec{a} =\langle 1,0,1 \rangle \quad \vec{b}= \langle 2,1,-1 \rangle$$
  $$\vec{b}-\vec{a} = \langle 1, 1, -2 \rangle$$
  $$\vec{u} = \langle 1, 1, -2 \rangle \quad \square$$

  <summary>Part B Solution</summary>
  You have a point on the line and the "slope" of the line through the parallel vector. You can move along the line by varying $t$.

<details>
  <summary>Part C Solution</summary>
  Yes, as long as your vector is paralle it will work to define the line. It would only change what $t$ corresponds to whawt point on a line. For example, if you had a vector $\vec{v_1}$ parallel to the line or $-\vec{v_1}$ both would be able to define the line. Lets say that $\vec{v_1}$ traverses the line in       "foward" direction when $t$ is positive then if you use $-\vec{v_1}$ to define the line you will move forward with $-t$. Regardless it produces the same line.

**UCB Problem 4.2**
<details>
  <summary>Part A Solution</summary>
  As my point I chose $(2,2,0)$
  $$\langle x-2, y-2, z \rangle \cdot \langle 1,1,-1 \rangle = 0$$
  $$(x-2) + (y-2) - z = 0$$
  $$x+y-z=4 \quad \square$$

  <summary>Part B Solution</summary>
  The vector is normal to tha plane because when it is dot producted with anything in the plane the result is always zero. Planes are defined using their normal vector.
