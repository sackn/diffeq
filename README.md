# Introduction

Welcome to my online textboook. I wrote this textbook over the summer of 2023 as a rising high school senior. I wanted to explore higher mathematics and thought it would be cool if I kept a little online website with all of the stuff I learned. That led me to create this online textbook. The online textbook includes content from Calculus 2, Caclulus 3, Differential Equations, and more. Everything is "hand-written" by me, and no writing is AI-generated. The majority of sections include thoughtful writing along with worked examples. For most of the sections, they also include practice problems at the end. For each practice problem, I provide a solution, which is either an image of my pen and paper work or a full solution written in LaTex.

The textbook is far from complete, and you may notice that some sections listed below aren't completely finished. However,  I will try my best to work on them. If you have noticed any issues, feel free to make a pull request, and I will work to fix them.

I hope some of my knowledge can do you well and that you enjoy the textbook!

# Notable Topics Currently Missing from Each Section

**Caclulus 2**

I had already finished Caclulus 2 by the time I wrote this textbook, so I didn't spend much time writing that section of the textbook. If you're interested in finding the entire standard Caclulus 2 circulum, refer to another online textbook (which I did not contribute to) by a teacher at Lamar University [Paul's Online Notes Calculus 2] (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calcII/calcII.aspx). The notable missing portions are:
  - Integration Methods (integration by parts, trignometric substituion, and partial fraction)
  - Improper Integrals
  - Application of Single varible Integral
  - Calculus with parametric equation and the polar coordinate system
The last section in the other online textbook lists vectors and an introduction to 3D space. I did not choose to group them in the Calulus 2 section, as I believe that they would better fit into their own section (cross product or dot product) or the start of the multivariable caclulus (vector-valued function).

**Caclulus 3**

The notable missing portion are:
- Triple Integrals 
- Green's Theorem
- Surface Integrals (includes Stokes and Divergence Theorem)
A teacher from Lamar University also created an online resource for Calculus 3 (which again I did not contribute to) [Paul's Online Notes Calculus 3] (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx). For extra problems, I also provided some solutions to "Multivariable Caclulus" by Don Shimamota linked to [Multivariable Calculus] (https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/780).

**Differential Equations**

The notable missing portions are:
- Series Solutions for Differential Equations / Fourier Series
- System of Differential Equations

The same teacher from Lamar University also created an online resource for ordinary differential equations (which again I did not contribute to): Paul's Online Notes on Differential Equations (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx). I also looked at another online textbook, "Differential Equation for Engineers" by Jiří Lebl.

**Everything Else**

For all of the other sections, I would advise against using my textbook as your sole source of content. The remaining sections are missing significant portions of their circulum. I am not particularly strong in any of the remaining topics; however, I would recommend watching the MIT Open Courseware lectures by Gilbert Strang if you are interested in studying linear algebra.
