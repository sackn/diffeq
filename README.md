# Introduction

Hello, my name is Chad Wong, and I am currently a freshman at UC Irvine majoring in electrical engineering. Welcome to my online textbook, where I write about all of the things I have learned over the 18 years that I have been alive. Most of the book is math, but I have been trying to expand it to include more electrical engineering (as it is my major, of course). I am extremely passionate about learning, and I plan on keeping this textbook alive for a long while. 

The website is handwritten. Most sections include well thought-out explanations and diagrams. All of the solutions and examples are done entirely by me. 

The textbook is far from complete, and you may notice that some sections listed below aren't completely finished. However, I will try my best to work on them. If you have noticed any issues, feel free to make a pull request, and I will work to fix them. 

I hope some of my knowledge can do you well and that you enjoy the textbook!

# Notable Topics Currently Missing from Each Section

**Caclulus 2**

I had already finished Caclulus 2 by the time I wrote this textbook, so I didn't spend much time writing that section of the textbook. If you're interested in finding the entire standard Caclulus 2 circulum, refer to another online textbook (which I did not contribute to) by a teacher at Lamar University [Paul's Online Notes Calculus 2] (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calcII/calcII.aspx). The notable missing portions are:
  - Integration Methods (integration by parts, trignometric substituion, and partial fraction)
  - Improper Integrals
  - Application of Single varible Integral
  - Calculus with parametric equation and the polar coordinate system
The last section in the other online textbook lists vectors and an introduction to 3D space. I did not choose to group them in the Calulus 2 section, as I believe that they would better fit into their own section (cross product or dot product) or the start of the multivariable caclulus (vector-valued function).

**Caclulus 3**

The notable missing portion are:
- Triple Integrals 
- Green's Theorem
- Surface Integrals (includes Stokes and Divergence Theorem)
A teacher from Lamar University also created an online resource for Calculus 3 (which again I did not contribute to) [Paul's Online Notes Calculus 3] (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx). For extra problems, I also provided some solutions to "Multivariable Caclulus" by Don Shimamota linked to [Multivariable Calculus] (https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/780).

**Differential Equations**

The notable missing portions are:
- Series Solutions for Differential Equations / Fourier Series
- System of Differential Equations

The same teacher from Lamar University also created an online resource for ordinary differential equations (which again I did not contribute to): Paul's Online Notes on Differential Equations (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx). I also looked at another online textbook, "Differential Equation for Engineers" by Jiří Lebl.

**Everything Else**

For all of the other sections, I would advise against using my textbook as your sole source of content. The remaining sections are missing significant portions of their circulum. I am not particularly strong in any of the remaining topics; however, I would recommend watching the MIT Open Courseware lectures by Gilbert Strang if you are interested in studying linear algebra.
